# (basic) TTML to VTT

I am using https://w3c.github.io/ttml-webvtt-mapping/#pre-processing-converting-ttml-to-tvtt as a guide, but applying the bare minimum to get the conversion done in my specifici and limited case (default `writingMode`, no nested elements in source TTML, etc.)

Still, a good starting point for a full-fledged converter :)
